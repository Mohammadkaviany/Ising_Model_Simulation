# Ising_Model_Simulation
By the Metropolis algorithm of computational physics , I have simulated the Ising model for a n x n configuration and checked its development under changes of temperature or other variables. 


I used python libraries like NumPy, matplotlib, and PIL to simulate the " Ising model " and show that phase transitions can occur based on some conditions. Ising model is expressed many years ago in explaining phase transitions in 1D and 2D. I simulated a 2D model in describing its features
